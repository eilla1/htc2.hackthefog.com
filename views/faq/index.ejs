            <h4>What is a virtual hackathon?</h4>
            <div>
                <p>A virtual hackathon is an online event where high schoolers can attend, learn, program and have fun. It will still have lots of the good stuff a physical hackathon has such as prizes and workshops.</p>

            <h4>What makes Hack the Cloud 2.0 different from other virtual hackathons?</h4>
            <div>
                <p>Hack the Cloud 2.0 is organized by a team that has experience with organizing hackathons and organized the first ever high school hackathon in San Francisco.</p>

            <h4>What if I don’t know how to code? Can I still attend?</h4>
            <div>
                <p>We love beginners at Hack the Cloud 2.0. We’ll have a plethora of workshops hosted by coders at several tech companies and startups in the Bay Area where you can learn skills people actually use in the industry. Have an idea but don’t know where to start? Our experienced staff and mentors will help guide you! DM us in the Discord or email us contact@hackthefog.com!</p>

            <h4>What if I don’t want to submit my hack?</h4>
            <div>
                <p>That’s totally fine! You are not obligated to submit anything to attend, this is just an event for you to learn and connect with other high school coders. For example, if you wanted to code something in a group with 5 other people (above the group limit according to the rules), there’s nothing stopping you, you just can’t submit your hack to be judged.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Hacks must be made by groups of up to four people, no more. Other than pre-made external libraries and tools, the code can only be made during the event. The project must be posted on Devpost before the end of the second day of the hackathon (July 12th 12 am PDT).</p>
                <p>Other than the above rules, you’re free to do whatever you want as long as you use common sense - don’t make things that would potentially hurt people in any way. Hack for good!</p>
